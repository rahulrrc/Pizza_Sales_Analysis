Pizza_Sales_Analysis

The "Pizza Sales Analysis" project is an industrial venture aimed at understanding and optimizing pizza sales for year 2022 through data analytics. This project was conducted in the final year of my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into pizza sales, helping businesses refine their offerings and optimize operations.

The primary objectives include:
1.Understanding Customer Preferences: Identifying the most and least popular pizzas, and understanding the preferences for different pizza sizes and categories.

2.Optimizing Operations: Analyzing sales trends to improve operational efficiency and better manage inventory and staffing.

3.Driving Business Growth: Using insights from data analysis to inform marketing strategies, product development, and overall business strategy.

The project employs a combination of SQL, Excel, and Power BI to handle, analyze, and visualize the pizza sales data:
-SQL: Used for querying and managing the data stored in databases, enabling efficient extraction and manipulation of data.

-Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, basic analysis, and initial visualizations, providing a flexible platform for data manipulation.

-Power BI: Leveraged for advanced data visualization and deeper analysis, allowing for the creation of interactive and insightful dashboards.

By integrating these tools, the project creates a powerful workflow that transforms raw sales data into actionable insights, ultimately helping pizza businesses to make informed decisions and enhance their competitive edge.
